# NST

Set-by-step tutorial for **NST**. I used official documentation and a lot of **Stack Overflow**.

**ADVICE:**
The whole point of this code is to penetrate the "outer shell" of the image to get as close as you can to the main object of the image ( you need to fine-tune convolutional layers for each new style image and main image ).

Overfitting in this case is not seen by numbers and fluctuation of the graph but by losing shape and objects..._




**WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT:**
